## üß© Overview

The **Milestone NFT Reward Contract** allows creators to define milestones and issue **achievement NFTs** to participants.  
Each NFT is **soulbound**, meaning it cannot be transferred or sold ‚Äî perfect for recognizing accomplishments or badges.

Key characteristics:
- Single active milestone at a time.
- Users claim NFT rewards for completing milestones.
- Off-chain metadata can be linked to milestones via IPFS or other decentralized storage.
- Fully self-contained **Solidity contract**: no imports, no constructors, no input parameters in external functions.
